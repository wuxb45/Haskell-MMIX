****Haskell MMIX
This is a full Haskell implementation of MMIX machine.
I have finished a complete CPU. but did not implement any devices yet.

****Diff
One difference between Haskell-MMIX and the MMIX in Knuth's documentation
is that Haskell-MMIX don't support ropcode 1 of the RESUME Insn.
This is because, as far as I know, you can always use ropcode 2 to
simulate any Insn. ropcode 1 can make the whole system much more complex.

****Usage
As we don't have any (I/O) devices, we cannot run programs on it now. Cool!
But in fact, you can run TRAP Insn with Zero-dev (a dev with zero on any address). Cool!
