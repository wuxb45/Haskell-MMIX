****Haskell MMIX
This is a full Haskell implementation of MMIX machine.
I have finished the full CPU. but not implement any devices yet.

****Diff
One difference with the MMIX documentation is that Haskell-MMIX don't support
ropcode 1 of RESUME Insn. This is because, as far as I know, you can always
use ropcode 2 to simulate any Insn, and ropcode 1 makes the system too complex.

****Usage
As we don't have devices, we cannot run programs on it now. Cool!
But in fact, you can run TRAP Insn with Zero-dev (a dev with only Zero). Cool!
